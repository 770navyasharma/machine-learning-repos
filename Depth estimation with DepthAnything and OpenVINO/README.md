# Depth Estimation with DepthAnything and OpenVINO

DepthAnything is a practical solution for robust monocular depth estimation. This project uses DepthAnything to build a strong foundation model for handling various images.

### Models

- **[Depth Anything V1 with OpenVINO](./depth-anything.ipynb)** 
- **[Depth Anything V2 with OpenVINO](./depth-anything-v2.ipynb)** 

### Notebook Contents

1. Install prerequisites
2. Load and run PyTorch model inference
3. Convert model to OpenVINO Intermediate Representation format
4. Run OpenVINO model inference on single image
5. Run OpenVINO model inference on video
6. Optimize model
7. Compare results of original and optimized models
8. Launch interactive demo

### Installation Instructions

This example is self-contained and relies only on its own code. It is recommended to run the notebook in a virtual environment. You only need a Jupyter server to start. For details, refer to the [Installation Guide](../../README.md).
